# Aether — Session Handoff

## Last Updated
2026-05-20 (Fused Q4_K matmul kernel v1 LANDED — bit-close to cuBLAS, 1.2x faster on FFN matmuls, eliminates the f32 transient = unblocks all-28-blocks-resident in 8 GB VRAM; v2 with split-K reduction is the next perf step)

## Project Status
🟢 **Audit: 169/196 (86%) — 10 of 19 phases at 100%**. matt-voice's
serving-deploy critical path within Aether's language + runtime is
materially complete: GGUF reader + Q4_K_M dequant + cuda routing
live, tokenizer.json + chat_template loaders, SafeTensors multi-
tensor parser. Remaining gates are multi-session work (full TLS
1.3, real forward pass through real weights at scale) or hardware-
binding (libnccl cross-card on cnc 2× P100).

- SSA-driven opt pipeline rewrites AST at --O1
- Regalloc plan drives callee-saved r12..r15 promotion
- AVX2 emit via aether_asm + recognised `__aether_avx2_dot_f32` builtin
- 23/23 honesty-auditor claims verified across the three commits

### Phase 17 closed to 100%
- conv2d CPU direct-loop reference (P17.3)
- Q4_0 GGUF dequant
- FlashAttention v2 (blocked online-softmax, matches naive SDPA)
- Real f32 Linear + LayerNorm witness

### Phase 19 closed to 100%
**13 items in one batch** (paged KV / continuous batching /
speculative decoding / multi-model / tool calling / rate-limit /
observability / vision / speech / ChaCha20-Poly1305 / HTTP/1.1 /
OpenAI shape / WS frame), plus **FR-19.9 BPE tokenizer** + **FR-
19.10 chat template renderer** + the **FR-19.16 partial tok/s bench
at 177 tok/s on Llama-shape** (well over the ≥100 threshold).

### matt-voice deploy pack — 5 FR-x-extras (commit 3283015)
- `cargo build -p aether_rt --features cuda` succeeds on kokonoe;
  libaether_rt.a has 39507 cuBLAS-symbol matches; cuda_train_tiny
  goes from skipped → real GPU train exit=0.
- FR-17.19-extra: SafeTensors multi-tensor parser (n_tensors /
  get_shape / get_dtype with the F32/F16/BF16/I32/I16/U8/I64 enum).
- FR-17.14-extra: Q4_K_M dequant kernel (real ggml 144-byte
  super-block layout; the format matt-voice's Qwen2.5-7B uses).
- FR-19.9-extra: HF tokenizer.json loader (hand-walks vocab + merges
  with explicit HF id preservation — essential for model weight
  indexing).
- FR-19.10-extra: chat_template.jinja file loader (wraps std::fs::read
  → render).
- Plus `aether_copy_cstr` helper: copies NUL-terminated `Expr::StrLit`
  literals from .rdata into heap buffers. Major witness-readability
  win — see `memory/aether_copy_cstr_pattern.md`.

### Real GGUF reader for Qwen2.5-7B (commit 172f423)
**The story**: user said Llama-1B weights were downloaded but
couldn't recall location. Searched extensively — no Llama-3-1B on
this machine. What IS local: matt-voice's actual base model,
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct Q4_K_M, in ollama's blob store as 4.7 GB at
`C:\Users\Matt\.ollama\models\blobs\sha256-2bada8a7...`.

User picked: use the local Qwen2.5-7B. Built a real GGUF v3 reader
that walks all 339 tensors. Witness verifies tensor 0 is
`token_embd.weight` at dtype 12 (= Q4_K = matt-voice's quant
format). Together with the FR-17.14-extra Q4_K_M dequant kernel
already shipped, Aether can now READ real Qwen2.5-7B weight bytes.

Three primitive layers shipped together:
1. `aether_gguf_open` + 8 walker fns
2. `aether_dequant_q4_k_m` (Qwen2.5's exact format)
3. cuBLAS routing via `--features cuda`

honesty-auditor verdicts across the session: **51/51 claims
verified, zero false** across 9 commits.

## Current State

**Working:**
- 169/196 audit-tagged witnesses pass.
- 10 phases at 100% (6-14 + 17 + 19).
- `cargo build -p aether_rt --features cuda` succeeds; cuBLAS path
  live for any `// requires: cuda` witness.
- Real Qwen2.5-7B Q4_K_M GGUF readable via `aether_gguf_*` extern
  surface.
- matt-voice's serving-deploy critical path's LANGUAGE work:
  - ✅ BPE algorithm + chat template engine
  - ✅ tokenizer.json + chat_template.jinja file loaders
  - ✅ Q4_K_M dequant + GGUF reader
  - ✅ SafeTensors multi-tensor parser
  - ✅ cuda runtime path live (cuBLAS sgemm + nvrtc kernels)
  - ⏳ Full forward pass through real Qwen2.5 weights at scale
  - ⏳ FR-19.1-extra full TLS 1.3 handshake (XL)
  - ⏳ FR-18.1-extra real libnccl link (hardware-binding)
  - ⏳ FR-19.16-extra Llama-1B at 100 tok/s on 3070 Ti (composite)

**Honest scaffold-vs-shipped notes** (updated):
- Phase 19's FR-19.16 ships a PARTIAL tok/s bench (177 tok/s on
  Llama-shape, NOT real Llama-1B). The witness header carves out
  the partial scope explicitly. The full Llama-1B target is
  FR-19.16-extra.
- The GGUF reader reads bytes only — no forward pass through real
  weights yet. The next gate (weight → dequant → matmul chain at
  every transformer layer) is multi-session.
- The "simulations" in Phase 18 are correctly named `*_simulate_*`
  so the simulation status is visible at the call site. Real
  multi-rank needs FR-18.1-extra libnccl + a second GPU.
- 4 known-OK stubs unchanged (mir/fuse.rs:53, mir/spec.rs:161,
  runtime_pe/src/lib.rs:59 + :443).
- Audit count for FR-x-extra tags doesn't advance (parent tag
  reuses) — design intent, not regression.

## Blocking Issues

None on the kokonoe-local side. Remaining gates are:
- **FR-19.1-extra full TLS 1.3** — XL effort, multi-session.
- **FR-17.19-extra-deeper Llama-1B real weights** — needs the
  ~1.3 GB Llama-3.2-1B SafeTensors download (auth-gated HF) OR
  use the local Qwen2.5-7B (already loaded, but bigger model).
- **FR-19.16-extra real ≥100 tok/s on real Llama-1B / 3070 Ti**
  — composite of the above + cuda matmul wiring through the
  dequant chain.
- **FR-18.1-extra real libnccl** — needs the cnc 2× P100 box
  (kokonoe is single-GPU).

## FR-18.1-extra — Real libnccl cross-card (LANDED)

Aether's runtime now supports REAL cross-GPU NCCL collectives,
verified end-to-end on cnc-server's 2× P100 box.

New surface (gated `--features nccl`):
- `runtime/src/nccl_real.rs` — `aether_nccl_real_init_multi_gpu(n)`
  wraps `ncclCommInitAll`; `_get_handle(rank)` / `_all_reduce_f32` /
  `_comm_world_size` / `_comm_rank` / `_finalize` round out the
  surface. Plus a Rust-side `comm_at(i)` accessor for integration
  tests that need to drive cudarc's typed API directly.
- `runtime/tests/nccl_dual_gpu.rs` — `Comm::from_devices(2)`,
  group_start/end, all_reduce sum: rank 0 sends 1.0s, rank 1 sends
  2.0s, both ranks see 3.0s. Verified on 2× P100.
- `runtime/tests/nccl_dual_gpu_dp_step.rs` — data-parallel
  training step: each rank computes gradient on its own shard
  (rank 0=1.0, rank 1=3.0), all_reduce sum, divide by ws → mean=2.0,
  identical SGD update on both ranks. The matt-voice unlock shape.

nvidia-smi confirmation: a single test process appears on BOTH GPU
UUIDs simultaneously (`bb77bda0...` first P100, `17bd0d20...` second
P100) with ~260+318 MiB allocations — physically proving cross-card
data exchange.

NCCL compatibility note: ollama's bundled libnccl 2.29 dropped sm_60
(Pascal) kernels and fails with "named symbol not found" on the
P100s. Aether links against libnccl 2.21.5+cuda12.4 from the local
fish-speech venv via `/usr/local/lib/libnccl.so.2` symlink. Documented
in NEXT-UP.

## Fused Q4_K matmul kernel v1 LANDED

User: "Go on fused kernel". Shipped a working fused Q4_K matmul
kernel that reads Q4_K bytes directly + dequants inline +
accumulates fma. No f32 transient buffer needed.

### Design (v1)
- CTA layout: BLOCK_N = 32 output columns per CTA
- One thread per output column (best for large N, weak for small N)
- Per K-tile (256 quants):
  - Cooperatively load 256 floats of A into shared mem (8 loads/thread,
    fully coalesced)
  - Each thread reads its own super-block of W (144 bytes), dequants
    inline, accumulates 256 fma's
  - Sync between K-tiles
- 1 KB shared memory per CTA (just A tile)
- Wrapper: `aether_op_fused_q4k_matmul_seq1_cuda(a_dev_f32, w_dev_u8,
  out_dev_f32, n, n_blocks)`

### Correctness verified
`runtime/tests/fused_q4k_matmul_real.rs` runs all 5 Q4_K matmul
shapes of Qwen2.5 block 0 and compares against `dequant -> cuBLAS
sgemm` reference. **All shapes match within 1.4e-5 absolute** (sum-
order differences between cuBLAS and our accumulate-into-thread
kernel).

### Measured perf on RTX 3070 Ti
```
tensor                       n      k    cuBLAS_us  fused_us  speedup
blk.0.attn_q.weight        3584   3584         100       127    0.79x
blk.0.attn_k.weight         512   3584          33       100    0.33x
blk.0.attn_output.weight   3584   3584          94       123    0.76x
blk.0.ffn_gate.weight     18944   3584         478       397    1.20x
blk.0.ffn_up.weight       18944   3584         475       396    1.20x
```

The v1 kernel is **faster than cuBLAS only on large-N FFN matmuls**.
For small N (attention projections), each output gets one thread
which under-utilizes the GPU (3584 threads << 6144 cores). A v2
kernel needs split-K reduction (multiple threads per output's dot
product, then warp-reduce) for small-N matmul wins.

### What the v1 kernel really unblocks: full-resident inference

Without fused matmul, every matmul needs a transient f32 dequant
buffer = 870 MB per block per matmul. With fused matmul, Q4_K
bytes go directly to f32 outputs — no transient. This is THE
enabler for keeping all 28 blocks of Qwen2.5-7B resident in 8 GB
VRAM throughout autoregressive generation.

### Remaining open FRs for matt-voice production speed

1. **Split-K Q4_K kernel (v2)** — multiple threads per output's
   dot product, warp-reduce. Estimated 2-3x more speedup on
   attention matmuls. ~100 LOC of careful CUDA.
2. **Tensor-core path for sm_8.0+** — RTX 3070 Ti is sm_8.6.
   Cast Q4_K dequant output to f16 + use wmma::fragment for the
   accumulate. Estimated 4-8x more speedup over current. Larger
   CUDA effort (~200-500 LOC).
3. **Q6_K fused matmul** — V proj + ffn_down. Same pattern as
   Q4_K but with the 210-byte super-block layout.
4. **Full end-to-end autoregressive measurement** with the fused
   kernel wired into the existing qwen25_autoregressive_cuda.rs.
   Quantify the real tok/s on Qwen2.5-7B inference.

## Q4_K + Q6_K dequant on GPU LANDED (memory enabler for matt-voice deploy)

User: "Get it to production speed". Plan was Q4_K-on-GPU to close
the llama.cpp gap. This session: the FOUNDATION (u8 device
registry + Q4_K/Q6_K dequant kernels + parity tests). The fused
dequant+matmul kernel that finishes the perf story remains the
single biggest remaining FR.

### Shipped
- `aether_dev_alloc_u8` / `_h2d_u8` / `_d2h_u8` / `_free_u8` --
  device byte buffer registry (parallel to f32 + i32 registries).
- `dequant_q4_k_m` CUDA kernel: 256 threads/CTA, 1 output per
  thread. Reads f16 d + dmin + 12 packed scales + 128 nibble-
  packed quants per 144-byte super-block.
- `dequant_q6_k` CUDA kernel: same shape, 210-byte super-blocks
  with ql[128] + qh[64] + scales[16] + f16 d.
- Both expose `aether_op_dequant_q*_f32_cuda(blocks_u8, out_f32,
  n_blocks)` wrappers.

### Bit-exact vs CPU on real Qwen2.5 weights
- `q4_k_dequant_cuda_parity.rs`: synth block + real
  blk.0.attn_q.weight first 4 super-blocks. `max_diff = 0`.
- `q6_k_dequant_cuda_parity.rs`: real blk.0.attn_v.weight
  (7168 super-blocks, 1.4M elements). `max_diff = 0`.
- `qwen25_block_forward_q4k_resident.rs`: 5 Q4_K tensors of
  Qwen block 0 verified bit-exact. **Total 84 MB Q4_K vs 623 MB
  f32 = 7.4x less PCIe** per block.

### Memory accounting (RTX 3070 Ti 8 GB)
- All 28 blocks of Qwen2.5-7B as Q4_K + Q6_K: ~6 GB **fits** with
  room for activations + KV cache.
- All 28 blocks as f32 dequant'd: ~24 GB **does NOT fit**.

Q4_K/Q6_K-on-GPU is what makes 8 GB VRAM enough to hold the
entire model. This is the unblock for matt-voice inference at
production scale.

### The final perf finisher (Q4_K matmul fusion) -- still open

Today: per matmul we dequant Q4_K -> transient f32 -> cuBLAS sgemm.
The transient f32 buffer is 4x the Q4_K size and the cuBLAS sgemm
runs over the bloated f32 (same as before). What llama.cpp does:
fused dequant+matmul where each CTA loads a tile of Q4_K bytes
into shared mem, dequants inline, then does sgemm-style accumulate
against the activation matrix in registers.

Engineering: ~500-1000 LOC of careful CUDA (tile sizing, shared
memory layout, warp-level math, tensor-core path on sm_8.0+).
Estimated ~10-50x additional speedup on top of today's bit-exact
dequant. That's the final piece for matt-voice production speed.

Tagged FR-17.14-extra-deepest in NEXT-UP. The Q4_K-on-GPU
foundation shipped this session is the prerequisite.

## GPU-native Qwen block forward LANDED — 115x speedup

User asked: "address major inference on gpu bugs/FR to bring to
parity with llama.cpp". Identified the dominant gap: every
non-matmul op in qwen forward was bouncing activations through
CPU (h2d/d2h per op). Shipped 5 new device kernels closing that:

### New CUDA kernels (added to KERNEL_SRC + ctx)
- `rms_norm_fwd` — RMSNorm `y = x * gamma / sqrt(mean(x^2) + eps)`
- `rope_apply`  — rotary in-place, half-half pair, Qwen-style
- `gqa_repeat_kv` — broadcast n_kv -> n_q heads (parallel copy)
- `silu_inplace` — `x = x / (1 + exp(-x))`
- `mul_inplace` / `add_inplace` / `bias_add` — element-wise

### New extern wrappers in runtime/src/cuda.rs
- `aether_op_rms_norm_f32_cuda(x, gamma, out, eps, rows, d)`
- `aether_op_rope_apply_f32_cuda(x, seq, n_heads, head_dim, base, pos_start)`
- `aether_op_gqa_repeat_kv_f32_cuda(in, out, seq, n_kv, head_dim, n_q)`
- `aether_op_silu_f32_cuda(x, n)`
- `aether_op_mul_inplace_f32_cuda(x, y, n)`
- `aether_op_add_inplace_f32_cuda(x, y, n)` (residual)
- `aether_op_bias_add_f32_cuda(x, bias, rows, cols)`

### Verification
- 5 parity tests (`matt_voice_ops_cuda_parity.rs`): every new
  kernel matches its CPU reference within 1e-4 / 1e-5.
- `qwen25_block_forward_full_gpu.rs` runs the entire block 0
  forward of real Qwen2.5-7B with all ops on device. Matches
  the CPU reference within `max_diff=2.956e-5` across all
  14336 output elements.

### Measured (release build, 11900K + RTX 3070 Ti)

| Phase | Time |
|---|---|
| CPU reference forward (block 0, seq=4) | 5.79 s |
| GPU all-on-device forward (block 0, seq=4) | **0.05 s** |
| Speedup vs CPU | **115×** |
| One-time h2d weight upload (per block) | 0.27 s |

For autoregressive generation per token:
- Prior cuBLAS-routed: ~4 s/token (per-op CPU bouncing dominated)
- Estimated new: ~1.4 s/token (28 blocks × 50 ms + h2d weight load)
- llama.cpp Q4_K-on-GPU reference: ~30 tok/s = 33 ms/token

### Remaining llama.cpp parity gap: Q4_K-on-GPU

The dominant remaining bug to close llama.cpp parity is **fused
dequant + matmul for Q4_K weights**. Today Aether dequantises
Q4_K_M block weights to f32 on the host then h2d's the f32:
- Memory: 870 MB f32 per block vs 217 MB Q4_K (4x)
- Bandwidth: 870 MB h2d per block vs 217 MB Q4_K (4x)
- Plus: cuBLAS sgemm on f32, not the fused dequant+matmul that
  llama.cpp implements

Implementing this is the single biggest remaining FR for matt-voice
production deploy. ~50× speedup expected. Scope:
1. Allocate Q4_K_M blocks (raw bytes) on device, not dequant'd f32
2. Custom CUDA kernel: dequant Q4_K block into shared mem, then
   sgemm-style matmul in same kernel
3. Apply to all `aether_op_matmul_f32_cuda` callsites that read
   Q4_K weights (full transformer forward)

Once shipped, matt-voice on RTX 3070 Ti should hit ~30 tok/s,
which is competitive with llama.cpp on the same hardware.

## FR-18.10 UNPARKED — 3-host TCP/IP all-reduce works

User said "we need 18.10 and 18.11" with kokonoe + cnc + satibook
available. All 3 hosts on 192.168.168.x LAN + Tailscale.

**Hardware pool:**
| Host | OS | LAN IP | GPU | VRAM |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| kokonoe | Windows | 192.168.168.121 | RTX 3070 Ti | 8 GB |
| cnc-server | Linux | 192.168.168.100 | 2× P100 | 12+16 GB |
| satibook | Windows | 192.168.168.200 | RTX 3050 Laptop | 6 GB |

Total **4 GPUs across 3 hosts, ~42 GB combined**.

**Shipped:**
- `aether_tcp_listen_addr(addr, n_addr, port)` -- bind to any
  interface (was 127.0.0.1-only).
- `aether_tcp_connect_host(host, n_host, port)` -- connect to any
  host (was 127.0.0.1-only).
- `trainer/src/bin/allreduce.rs` -- new `aether-allreduce` binary.
  Rank 0 = rendezvous server (listens 0.0.0.0), ranks 1..N-1 =
  clients. Per all-reduce: rank 0 collects buffers from each peer,
  computes sum, broadcasts.

**3-host run verified:**
```
kokonoe rank 0 (value=1) -> received [7.0, 7.0, ...]
cnc     rank 1 (value=2) -> received [7.0, 7.0, ...], RTT 158 ms
satibook rank 2 (value=4) -> received [7.0, 7.0, ...], RTT 25 ms
Sum: 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 ✓ across all ranks
```

**Operational notes documented in memory:**
- `three_host_pool_setup.md` -- inventory, firewall fix
  (`netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="aether-N"
  dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=N`), build commands
  per host.

## FR-18.11 partial — 4-GPU shape, 8-GPU still gated by hardware

The original FR-18.11 spec is "8-GPU Llama-7B training". With 4
GPUs in the pool, the full 8-card witness can't run. But all
PROTOCOL components are proven:
- Multi-host all-reduce (above)
- Per-host data-parallel (`nccl_dual_gpu_dp_step`, `_resident`)
- KV cache + autoregressive (`qwen25_autoregressive_cuda`)
- Block-streaming weight load (`qwen25_full_inference`)

Combining into a 4-host distributed training run that trains
matt-voice across all 4 GPUs is the next-session bridge.

## aether-serve HTTP binary + LoRA apply LANDED

### LoRA apply
`runtime/src/ops.rs::apply_lora_f32` + extern wrapper
`aether_op_apply_lora_f32`: in-place update of an Aether matmul-
layout weight by `W += scale * A^T @ B^T`. PEFT-compatible
convention (A=[rank,d_in], B=[d_out,rank]).

Tests:
- Unit: zero LoRA = no-op identity; matmul-layout math matches
  direct computation for a 2x3 case with hand-traced expected.
- `runtime/tests/qwen25_lora_apply.rs`: applies a synthetic rank-8
  LoRA to REAL Qwen2.5 blk.0.attn_q.weight (3584×3584 Q4_K dequant).
  Probes 4 specific (i_in, i_out) cells; each delta matches the
  scale*A^T@B^T direct computation to 1e-4. Frobenius norm grows
  by 0.61% (LoRA had measurable effect). 12.84M elements in 0.02s.

### HTTP server
`trainer/src/bin/serve.rs`: new `aether-serve` binary. Listens on
the chosen port, accepts HTTP requests, parses with
`aether_http_parse_request`, renders OpenAI-shape JSON via
`aether_openai_render_completion`, sends back via
`aether_http_write_response_200` + `aether_tcp_send`.

Build + run:

cargo build -p trainer --bin aether-serve
target/debug/aether-serve --port 8080 --model matt-voice
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"prompt_ids":[9707,11,1879,0],"max_tokens":5}'
```

Returns proper OpenAI JSON:
```json
{
  "id":"chatcmpl-aether-serve-1","object":"chat.completion",
  "model":"matt-voice",
  "choices":[{"index":0,"message":{"role":"assistant","content":"..."},"finish_reason":"stop"}],
  "usage":{"prompt_tokens":N,"completion_tokens":M}
}
```

**Status:** The HTTP wire-up is complete. The `content` field
currently returns a stub message; integrating the real Qwen2.5-7B
autoregressive forward chain (from `qwen25_autoregressive_cuda.rs`)
into `handle_request` is ~300 LOC of mechanical copy + JSON body
parsing for `prompt_ids` / `max_tokens`. Tracked as the final
ship gate.

`runtime/tests/aether_serve_http_wireup.rs` end-to-end-tests the
full HTTP loop without the 24 GB model load: TCP listen → accept
→ parse → render → respond → verify. Runs in ~100 ms.

## cuBLAS-routed autoregressive generation LANDED

`runtime/tests/qwen25_autoregressive_cuda.rs` -- same shape as the
CPU autoregressive test but every matmul routes through cuBLAS via
a per-call host-pointer wrapper (`matmul_via_cublas`: dev_alloc /
h2d / sgemm / d2h / free).

Per-token cost: **53s (CPU) -> 4s (cuBLAS) -- 13x speedup**.
Prefill: 206s -> 4.5s -- 45x. Total 4 prompt + 5 generated:
501s -> 106s.

CORRECTNESS: generated IDs are byte-identical between CPU and
cuBLAS runs: [9707, 11, 1879, 0, 358, 2776, 264, 220, 17]. Same
logits to 3 decimals. Strong determinism signal across backends.

Non-matmul ops (RMSNorm/RoPE/GQA/SiLU/attention) stay on CPU.
Routing all of them through GPU would be FR-x-extra-deeper but the
13x matmul-only speedup is already enough to make Aether-Qwen
inference usable for matt-voice serving.

## Tokenizer integration LANDED (decode side)

`runtime/tests/qwen25_tokenizer_roundtrip.rs` -- loads Qwen2.5's
embedded tokenizer (152064 vocab + 151386 merges + BOS/EOS ids)
from GGUF metadata into `aether_bpe_tokenizer`. Decodes the
autoregressive output to actual coherent English:

```
[decode] "Hello,Ġworld!ĠI'mĠaĠ2" (surface)
[decode] "Hello, world! I'm a 2" (real text)
```

Token IDs from the autoregressive run, when decoded with the
GPT-2 byte fixup, produce **real coherent text**. This is the
matt-voice deploy proof: real prompt -> real Qwen inference -> real
generated text, all through Aether's runtime.

New runtime surface (4 GGUF metadata accessors):
- `aether_gguf_get_metadata_u32(handle, key, key_len) -> i64`
- `aether_gguf_get_metadata_string(handle, key, key_len, out, max) -> i32`
- `aether_gguf_get_metadata_array_string_n(handle, key, key_len) -> i32`
- `aether_gguf_get_metadata_array_string_get(handle, key, key_len, idx, out, max) -> i32`

GGUF parser refactor: previously the metadata KV table was SKIPPED
during parse. Now U32, String, and StringArray values are captured
into a `HashMap<String, GgufMeta>` on the GgufFile struct. All
other types still skip (memory hygiene).

**Known limitation: encode** (text -> IDs) requires unicode-char-
level initial split because Qwen uses GPT-2 BPE with the bytes-to-
unicode mapping. Aether's `aether_bpe_encode` does byte-level
initial split. For matt-voice's inference deploy this is fine
(user tokenizes externally; Aether takes IDs); but full in-Aether
text-in-text-out requires extending the encoder. FR-x-extra.

## Autoregressive generation LANDED

`runtime/tests/qwen25_autoregressive_gen.rs` produces multi-token
generated output from a 4-token prompt through real Qwen2.5-7B
with **per-block KV cache**.

Architecture:
- `BlockWeights`: all 12 matmul-targeted weights + biases per block
  loaded + transposed ONCE before generation (~24 GB f32 total for
  all 28 blocks).
- `KvCache`: per-block `Vec<f32>` storage for past K and V
  activations. Grows by `seq * D_KV` per call.
- `block_forward_kv`: handles BOTH prefill (seq=prompt_len) and
  per-step (seq=1) modes. Q/K/V projection on the new tokens only;
  K/V appended to cache; attention reads from cache.

End-to-end run:
```
[all blocks loaded]   71.74s -- 28 blocks * ~2.6s each
[lm_head xpose]        6.62s
[prefill]            206.00s -- 4 tokens through 28 blocks
[gen 1/4]             53.04s -- next_id=2776 logit=13.374
[gen 2/4]             53.83s -- next_id=264  logit=12.557
[gen 3/4]             53.66s -- next_id=220  logit=15.310
[gen 4/4]             54.27s -- next_id=17   logit=27.127
[total]              501.61s
Generated IDs: [9707, 11, 1879, 0, 358, 2776, 264, 220, 17]
                 (prompt 4 tokens)  (5 generated)
```

Per-token cost dropped from 270s (full re-forward) to **53s** with
KV cache -- a 5x speedup. The model produces increasingly confident
predictions (logit 10.3 → 27.1) which is normal autoregressive
behaviour as context extends.

Test is `#[ignore]`d (~8 min run). Invoke explicitly:
```
cargo test -p aether_rt --release --test qwen25_autoregressive_gen \
  -- --ignored --nocapture
```

## What's still left for shipping matt-voice end-to-end

Two items from the prior 4-item list LANDED this session (GPU-
routed inference + tokenizer decode). Remaining gap:

1. **(DONE)** Tokenizer integration -- 152064 vocab + 151386 merges
   loaded from GGUF metadata; decode verified producing real
   English ("Hello, world! I'm a 2"). Encode side has a known
   limitation (unicode-char-level BPE not yet wired); FR-x-extra.
2. **HTTP server wrap** -- new `trainer/src/bin/serve.rs` that
   loops `accept -> parse_request -> tokenize_external_or_skip ->
   forward_loop -> render_completion`. The TCP + HTTP + OpenAI
   render fns are all shipped. Mostly composition.
3. **LoRA adapter loading** -- matt-voice's adapter from candle.
   Each block's W becomes W + (B @ A) * (alpha/rank). SafeTensors
   loader is shipped; needs an "apply lora" helper that mutates
   loaded block weights in-place.
4. **(DONE)** GPU-routed inference -- cuBLAS for every matmul,
   13x speedup, byte-identical IDs. Full-GPU (all ops on device)
   is FR-x-extra-deeper.

So the remaining matt-voice ship work is: HTTP server binary + LoRA
adapter loader + (optionally) full-text encoder. ~1 focused session.

## Full Qwen2.5-7B inference LANDED

`runtime/tests/qwen25_full_inference.rs` stacks the block-0 forward
28 times via a streaming-dequant loop. End-to-end inference through
Aether's runtime: tokens → 28 blocks → final_norm → lm_head → argmax.

Measured 270s total on 11900K release-build for a 4-token forward:
- 28 blocks × ~9s each (FFN-dominated)
- lm_head load + transpose: 5.2s
- lm_head matmul [4, 3584] @ [3584, 152064]: 14.8s

Argmax predictions for input [9707, 11, 1879, 0] ("Hello, world!"-ish):
```
pos 0 (token 9707) -> argmax 358, logit 8.04  (range -18.98..8.04)
pos 1 (token 11)   -> argmax 358, logit 10.11
pos 2 (token 1879) -> argmax 2219, logit 13.33
pos 3 (token 0)    -> argmax 358, logit 10.26
```

All logits finite, no NaN/Inf, argmax IDs in vocab. Token 358 is
"" I"" in Qwen's BPE -- a very common next-token prediction.

Test is `#[ignore]`d by default; explicit invocation:
```
cargo test -p aether_rt --release --test qwen25_full_inference -- --ignored --nocapture
```

## GPU-resident DP step LANDED

`runtime/tests/nccl_dual_gpu_resident.rs` proves that weights live
on each P100's device across N optimization steps -- the matt-voice
training-deploy shape minus QMatMul.

Per step (W never touches host):
1. compute_grad kernel on device: `grad = 2 * (W - target)`
2. NCCL all_reduce across ranks (already device-resident)
3. sgd_step kernel on device: `W -= (lr / world_size) * grad`
4. (Loss d2h only every 10 steps for logging, NOT training-critical)

Verified on cnc 2× P100:
```
[gpu-resident-dp ws=2] step=   0 loss=0.056009
[gpu-resident-dp ws=2] step=  10 loss=0.000646
[gpu-resident-dp ws=2] step=  20 loss=0.000007
[gpu-resident-dp ws=2] step=  30 loss=0.000000
[gpu-resident-dp] W on device for 50 steps, ranks byte-identical
```

nvidia-smi: PID 2560518 on BOTH GPU UUIDs at 368 MiB each.

Three CUDA kernels (compute_grad, sgd_step, sq_diff) JIT-compiled
via cudarc's nvrtc per device. Note: cudarc's nvrtc binding wants
`libnvrtc-builtins.so.12.1` even when the system CUDA is 12.8 --
symlink from torch's nvidia-cuda-nvrtc pip wheel. Documented in
`memory/cnc_nvrtc_builtins_path.md`.

## Real Qwen2.5-7B block forward LANDED

`runtime/tests/qwen25_block_forward.rs` runs the FULL decoder block 0
forward pass on matt-voice's actual Qwen2.5-7B Q4_K_M/Q6_K GGUF.

End-to-end chain through Aether's runtime:
1. Open GGUF (matt-voice 4.7 GB blob in ollama blob store)
2. Find + dequantise all 13 block-0 tensors:
   - 4 F32 (norms + 3 biases)
   - 7 Q4_K (Wq, Wk, Wo, ffn_gate, ffn_up, attn_k.bias-x, token_embd)
   - 2 Q6_K (Wv, ffn_down) -- new aether_dequant_q6_k kernel
3. Transpose weights (GGUF stores [d_in inner, d_out outer]; matmul
   wants [d_in, d_out])
4. Lookup 4 token-embedding rows -> X[4, 3584]
5. attn_norm RMSNorm (new aether_op_rms_norm_f32)
6. Q/K/V proj matmuls (uneven dims: Q[seq,3584], K/V[seq,512])
7. RoPE on Q+K (new aether_op_rope_apply_f32, Qwen base=1e6)
8. GQA repeat K/V from 4 KV heads to 28 Q heads (new
   aether_op_gqa_repeat_kv_f32)
9. Causal SDPA over 28 heads
10. Output proj + residual
11. ffn_norm RMSNorm
12. SwiGLU MLP: matmul(gate) + matmul(up) -> silu(gate)*up ->
    matmul(down) + residual

Output: max_abs=5.88, sum=-7.02, no NaN/Inf, total time 9.36s in
release build on 11900K. Per-token L2 norms differ (row0=29.0,
row3=16.4) -- attention mixed information across positions, not a
trivial pass-through.

Three new ops shipped this session:
- `aether_op_rms_norm_f32(x, gamma, eps, out, rows, d)` -- the
  Qwen/Llama-style normalisation (no beta).
- `aether_op_rope_apply_f32(x, seq, n_heads, head_dim, base, pos_start)`
  -- rotary embeddings in-place, llama-style "half-half" pair
  layout.
- `aether_op_gqa_repeat_kv_f32(in, out, seq, n_kv, head_dim, n_q)`
  -- GQA broadcast.

Two new GGUF helpers:
- `aether_gguf_find_tensor_by_name(handle, name, n)` -- linear-scan
  lookup; avoids manually iterating all 339 tensors.
- `aether_gguf_get_tensor_n_elems(handle, i)` -- product of dims.

Plus the Q6_K dequantisation kernel
(`aether_dequant_q6_k`) ported from ggml's reference decoder.

5 new unit tests for the three ops (RMSNorm scale invariance + unit
gamma; RoPE pos-0 identity + L2 norm preservation; GQA repeat) +
1 Q6_K dequant test against real Qwen V-proj weights (max_abs=0.023).

## Dual-P100 training LANDED

`aether-train --world-size 2 --features nccl` trains a model across
both P100s end-to-end via NCCL gradient all-reduce. Verified on
cnc-server:

```
[aether-train-dp ws=2] step=    0 loss=5.5676 lr=3.00e-4 elapsed=0.1s
[aether-train-dp ws=2] step=   50 loss=2.1998 lr=2.68e-3 elapsed=3.4s
[aether-train-dp ws=2] step=  100 loss=0.1044 lr=1.62e-3 elapsed=6.8s
[aether-train-dp ws=2] step=  150 loss=0.0420 lr=4.84e-4 elapsed=10.1s
[aether-train-dp ws=2] step=  199 loss=0.0307 lr=2.05e-7 elapsed=13.3s
[aether-train-dp] final params identical across ranks: true (sampled first 8 of 85504)
```

nvidia-smi proof: aether-train PID 2044863 visible on BOTH GPU
UUIDs simultaneously (368 MiB on `bb77bda0...` first P100,
368 MiB on `17bd0d20...` second P100). Real cross-card data
exchange via libnccl 2.21.5 ncclAllReduce.

Shape of the loop:
- `trainer/src/dp.rs::train_dp` — N Model instances (same seed),
  per-step: per-rank batch shard, forward/backward, h2d host grads,
  group_start/per-rank all_reduce(Sum)/group_end, d2h, scale by
  1/world_size, AdamW. Final-state invariant check confirms ranks
  end with identical params.
- `trainer/Cargo.toml` `nccl` feature forwards to `aether_rt/nccl`
  + adds cudarc 0.13 for the typed group_start/end API.
- `trainer/src/main.rs --world-size N` dispatches to train_dp.

## What's Next

Items 1 + 2 from the prior "What's Next" + the GPU-resident
weights variant + FR-18.1-extra + dual-P100 training all shipped
this session. Remaining matt-voice deploy work:

1. **(DONE)** Multi-rank training-loop bringup. `aether-train
   --world-size 2 --features nccl` works on cnc 2× P100; loss
   declines, params identical at convergence.
1b. **(DONE)** Full-model multi-block stack -- 28 decoder blocks +
   final_norm + lm_head ship in `qwen25_full_inference.rs`. Streaming
   dequant (~870 MB peak). Argmax predictions verified.
1c. **(DONE)** GPU-resident DP step -- W on device across iters,
   loss converges to 0 on cnc 2× P100. The matt-voice training-
   deploy shape minus QMatMul.
2. **Pipeline-parallel 1F1B real impl** (matt-voice §FR-18.6).
   Today's `aether_pp_simulate_2stage_forward_f32` is in-process.
   Real PP needs send/recv between adjacent ranks via the
   `Comm::send` / `Comm::recv` surface in cudarc::nccl. Foundation
   shipped; scheduling is the remaining work.
3. **All ops on device** (FR-19.16-extra deepest). LN / SDPA / SiLU
   still run CPU-side and drive the per-iter h2d/d2h pattern in
   `aether_llm_inference_bench_tps_cuda_resident`. Route those
   through cuda.rs's existing device-kernel variants.
4. **Forward-pass over a whole transformer block on real Qwen2.5
   weights**. The one-block witness proves dequant → matmul
   composes. Next is iterating the chain through Q/K/V/O matmuls +
   attention + MLP for one full block.
5. **Llama-1B-scale dims** (d=2048, ff=5504, 16 layers). At those
   dims cuBLAS sgemm dominates and the resident bench headline
   grows much larger.
6. **Phase 15 leftovers**: FR-15.7 (SWP), FR-15.10 (hand-asm gate
   for the v4 SHIP perf claim).
7. **Phase 16 leftovers**: proc-macros, Drop, slice/str primitives.

NOTE on TCP test flake: `tests::tcp_send_recv_loopback` at
`runtime/src/lib.rs:3492` fails ~1/3 runs with "accept returned -1"
under Windows firewall / port contention. Unrelated to any 2026-05-19
work. If the audit-agent protocol re-runs it during honesty-auditor
and reports it as failing, it's a known flake.

Phase 18's remaining 2 are hardware-blocked; not next-session
attackable.

## Notes for Next Session

- **`aether_copy_cstr` is the new go-to** for passing string
  literals to extern fns. The witness footprint shrinks dramatically
  (90 lines → 50 lines is typical). See
  `memory/aether_copy_cstr_pattern.md`.
- **GGUF v3 has a BOOL=1-byte pitfall** at value type 7. My parser
  groups it correctly with u8/i8 in the 1-byte size branch;
  preserving that grouping is critical when adding new GGUF features.
  See `memory/gguf_v3_bool_pitfall.md`.
- **matt-voice's actual Qwen2.5-7B blob** is at
  `C:\Users\Matt\.ollama\models\blobs\sha256-2bada8a7...`
  (4.7 GB Q4_K_M). The GGUF reader walks it cleanly; tensor 0 is
  `token_embd.weight`. See `memory/matt_voice_qwen_blob_location.md`.
- **FR-x-extra tags reuse the parent's primary roadmap ID** —
  audit count doesn't advance, but the work is real. The
  honesty-auditor checks impl + non-claims carve-outs, not the
  audit-count delta. See `memory/fr_x_extra_tag_convention.md`.
- **`--features cuda` build is now active.** New witnesses that
  exercise the GPU should tag `// requires: cuda`. The audit's
  runtime_check.rs detects cuda via "cublas"/"cudart6" symbol
  presence in libaether_rt.a (now present).
- **Llama-1B was NOT found locally** despite the user thinking it
  was downloaded. If matt-voice deploy needs Llama-3.2-1B specifically
  (vs the local Qwen2.5-7B), that's a 1.3 GB HF download (auth-
  gated). Most matt-voice work targets Qwen anyway per
  `MATT_VOICE_FR.md`.
- **honesty-auditor protocol still applies**. 51/51 claims this
  session held up — keep using it on perf-relevant or claim-heavy
  work.
- **No Python for tooling.** Same as always.
